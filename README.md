This website displays multiple tables, each containing a different RSS feed. The design of the website is professional and user-friendly, with a menu bar that has a black border and a separate CSS file for styling.

The site uses JavaScript to parse the RSS feeds and display the data in the tables. The RSSParser library is used to make the data from the feeds available to the JavaScript code, allowing the site to dynamically display the latest information from the feeds.
